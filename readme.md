# hiit-helper
A tool to keep time during HIIT sessions.

Set the 'Exercise Interval' to determine the length of each exercise, signalled with a beep (800Hz).

Set the 'Countdown Quantity' to determine the number of countdown beeps (600Hz). The selected quantity will cause a beep for each second selected, before the next exercise interval. This cannot be equal to or more than the Exercise Interval.
